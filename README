           INSTRUCTIONS
          
The compressed tar file tron.tar.gz contains the MINPACK-2 
trust region method for the solution of large bound-constrained
optimization problems.

1. Create the tron directory structure with

       gzip -d tron.tar.gz
       tar -xvf tron.tar

   This produces the directory tron and several subdirectories.

2. Set the environment variable ARCH. Installation has been tested
   on linux, rs6000, solaris, irix, and alpha systems. Installation 
   usually works on other systems but has not been tested. The file
   README in the utils directory contains more systems information.

3. Change directories to tron and install tron with
 
       make install

   This creates libraries in each of the subdirectories and
   the executable tron

4. Run the sample problems by executing tron, and compare the output in 
   tron.info with the output on a similar system, tron.linux, for example.
